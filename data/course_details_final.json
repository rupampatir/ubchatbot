[{"Course Title": "CSE 510LEC: Special Topic: Signals and Systems for Wireless Sensing", "Course Description": "The course introduces basic elements of wireless signals and wireless sensing. The focus is on Monostatic and Bi-static Wireless Sensing which has brought wide applications ranging from localization, navigation, breathing, heart-rate estimation, autonomous driving perception, and many more to come. To understand these wireless sensing systems, we will cover the basics of signals and systems, that focus on continuous and discrete time. Fourier series and transforms. Linear Time-Invariant Systems. Impulse response, frequency response, and transfer functions. Convolution. Sampling. Aliasing. We will then focus on Single-carrier wireless transceiver design, Wireless Signal modulation, Mono-Static Sensing, and Bi-Static Sensing, and finally discuss the current ML-based Wireless sensor systems.", "Program Requirements": {"phd_reqs": "CSE 510LEC does not fulfill PhD program breadth or depth requirements.", "ms_reqs": "CSE 510LEC does not fulfill MS program breadth or depth requirements."}, "Course Instances": [{"Term": "Spring 2024", "Title": "Special Topic: Network Security", "Instructor": "Hongxin Hu", "Dates": "01/24/2024 - 05/07/2024", "Days": "TR", "Times": "11:00AM-12:20PM", "Credit Hours": "1.00-3.00", "Enrolled": "22/60"}, {"Term": "Spring 2024", "Title": "Special Topic: Signals and Systems for Wireless Sensing", "Instructor": "Sai Roshan Ayyalasomayajula", "Dates": "01/24/2024 - 05/07/2024", "Days": "TR", "Times": "2:00PM-3:20PM", "Credit Hours": "1.00-3.00", "Enrolled": "5/14"}, {"Term": "Spring 2023", "Title": "Special Topic: Internet-Scale Systems Design", "Instructor": "Matthew D.

Most sensing and actuation is uncertain. We study Bayes filter as the framework for probabilistically reasoning about this uncertainty while being able to predict the robot state at any given instant. Specifically, we look at the problems of localization (where am i?) and mapping (what is around me?), the two fundamental problems in mobile robots.

The course will cover connectionist architectures commonly associated with deep learning, e.g., basic neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.", "Program Requirements": {"phd_reqs": "CSE 676LEC fulfills one Artificial Intelligence (AI) Depth PhD program requirement.", "ms_reqs": "CSE 676LEC fulfills one Artificial Intelligence (AI) Depth MS program requirement."}, "Course Instances": [{"Term": "Spring 2024", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Changyou Chen", "Dates": "01/24/2024 - 05/07/2024", "Days": "MW", "Times": "5:00PM-6:20PM", "Credit Hours": "3.00", "Enrolled": "29/70"}, {"Term": "Spring 2024", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Alina Vereshchaka", "Dates": "01/24/2024 - 05/07/2024", "Days": "TR", "Times": "5:00PM-6:20PM", "Credit Hours": "3.00", "Enrolled": "135/230"}, {"Term": "Spring 2024", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Kaiyi Ji", "Dates": "01/24/2024 - 05/07/2024", "Days": "TR", "Times": "12:30PM-1:50PM", "Credit Hours": "3.00", "Enrolled": "60/60"}, {"Term": "Fall 2023", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Jue Guo", "Dates": "08/28/2023 - 12/11/2023", "Days": "TR", "Times": "5:00PM-6:20PM", "Credit Hours": "3.00", "Enrolled": "42/42"}, {"Term": "Fall 2023", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Kaiyi Ji", "Dates": "08/28/2023 - 12/11/2023", "Days": "TR", "Times": "11:00AM-12:20PM", "Credit Hours": "3.00", "Enrolled": "46/50"}, {"Term": "Summer 2023", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Alina Vereshchaka", "Dates": "05/30/2023 - 07/07/2023", "Days": "MW", "Times": "1:00PM-4:15PM", "Credit Hours": "3.00", "Enrolled": "59/95"}, {"Term": "Spring 2023", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Charuvahan Adhivarahan", "Dates": "01/30/2023 - 05/12/2023", "Days": "MW", "Times": "5:00PM-6:20PM", "Credit Hours": "3.00", "Enrolled": "53/66"}, {"Term": "Spring 2023", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Changyou Chen", "Dates": "01/30/2023 - 05/12/2023", "Days": "TR", "Times": "12:30PM-1:50PM", "Credit Hours": "3.00", "Enrolled": "59/60"}, {"Term": "Fall 2022", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Wen Dong", "Dates": "08/29/2022 - 12/09/2022", "Days": "F", "Times": "11:00AM-1:50PM", "Credit Hours": "3.00", "Enrolled": "100/165"}, {"Term": "Spring 2022", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Changyou Chen", "Dates": "01/31/2022 - 05/13/2022", "Days": "TR", "Times": "3:30PM-4:50PM", "Credit Hours": "3.00", "Enrolled": "179/250"}, {"Term": "Fall 2021", "Title": "Deep Learning", "Instructor": "Sargur N.

They show definite human tendencies and foibles, some of which are used to distinguish human from computer play and catch instances of human players cheating via computer assistance. The focus will be on making larger conclusions, with the following among multiple possible objectives: (1) How can learning growth of young players be measured? The pandemic brought this need to the fore while official ratings were largely frozen, and the international chess rating system on the whole is still far from recovered. (2) Following on from (1), where does the notorious gender gap in chess begin, and what are implications for STEM education? (3) Can notions of difficulty of chess games crafted in the model be carried over to yield internal means of evaluating the difficulty of standardized tests? The mathematics of chess ratings (which are based on logistic curves) and of formulas in item response theory and other areas of psychometrics have commonalities (**). (4) Can this model be extended to offer a simple frequentist alternative to neural methods of ChatGPT (etc.) cheat detection, noting how the \"best next word\" architecture relates to \"best next move\" in game play? (5) How does the model supplement other forms of statistical analysis? (***) (6) What external lessons are there for statistical practice? (****) The seminar will begin with several weeks of introduction to chess data, the model, and the software written in C++ and Perl and Python. The intent is to carry out some hands-on projects, more than presenting papers, though it can have a mix of both seminar styles. One project already underway with non-UB co-workers involves subjects in my most recent chess article https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/08/04/should-these-quantities-be-linear/ but there is more to do here as well, not to mention the question of whether the cognitive relationships shown should be linear with the force of physical law.

The material covered in this class includes the most prevalent and successful models and techniques and will give you the necessary tools to incorporate current results, e.g. SLAM implementations and sampling based planners, into your own robots.", "Program Requirements": {"phd_reqs": "CSE 668LEC fulfills one Artificial Intelligence (AI) Depth PhD program requirement.", "ms_reqs": "CSE 668LEC fulfills one Artificial Intelligence (AI) Depth MS program requirement."}, "Course Instances": [], "Course Code": "CSE 668"}, {"Course Title": "CSE 724SEM: Seminar: Database Systems for Data Quality and Curation", "Course Description": "This course will survey research systems, tools, and techniques for data quality management.

With more than 20 billion such connected devices that pervade every corner of the world, IoT is able to benefit a whole spectrum of civilian and military applications with enormous societal and economic impacts. Powered by the interconnected IoT devices, now any person can share his observations about any activities, events or objects anywhere and at any time. Such crowd-contributed sensory data constitute the largest-ever information source that covers almost every aspect of our lives, and thus can facilitate a broad spectrum of applications, such as smart city and transportation, localization and navigation, activity and gesture recognition, healthcare and assisted living, and environmental monitoring. In this seminar, we will survey existing algorithms, systems, and applications of Internet of Things, and discuss key opportunities as well as challenges emerging in the research of this area.", "Program Requirements": {"phd_reqs": "CSE 729SEM does not fulfill PhD program breadth or depth requirements.", "ms_reqs": "CSE 729SEM does not fulfill MS program breadth or depth requirements."}, "Course Instances": [], "Course Code": "CSE 729"}, {"Course Title": "CSE 745SEM: Seminars", "Course Description": "This course is a seminar.
