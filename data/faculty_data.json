Computing touches all aspects of our lives and sometimes in ways that are not beneficial (even though the intent of the developer is not to cause harm). What has become clear is that we cannot develop systems for society without meaningful and deep collaborations with disciplines that have thought about society for much longer than computing. The challenge is to incorporate knowledge from humanistic studies from day one in the design of computing systems."

                    "Society and Computing1/17/23Computing is ubiquitous in society today. Computing touches all aspects of our lives and sometimes in ways that are not beneficial (even though the intent of the developer is not to cause harm). What has become clear is that we cannot develop systems for society without meaningful and deep collaborations with disciplines that have thought about society for much longer than computing. The challenge is to incorporate knowledge from humanistic studies from day one in the design of computing systems."
